## About

This repo documents my work around distributing Robin DiAngelo's White Fragility
in zine form. This repo (and the [website](http://w-f.is)) offers an easy-to-read
 and easy-to-share version of Robin DiAngelo's White Fragility. You can read the 
entire paper, as well as print, assemble and distribute your own White Fragility
 zine.

Once upon a time, someone shared this paper. Later, someone else found it
useful. With Robin DiAngelo's permission, we decided to spread her words far and
wide across the land. During the Public Science Winter Residency, we distributed
the White Fragility zine on the subway, handed them out to our close friends and
strangers, mailed it across the country, and traded them for donations at a
Internet-ish flea market. We are excited to see where you take it next. 

We hope you find it useful too. As the saying goes, talking about race shouldn't
be so stressful -_-
